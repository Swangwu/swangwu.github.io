            processing (NLP) and recently influenced the computer vision (CV) space.
            The similarities between computer vision and medical imaging, reviewed
            the question among researchers if the impact of transformers on computer
            vision be translated to medical imaging? In this paper, we attempt to
            provide a comprehensive and recent review on the application of
            transformers in medical imaging by; describing the transformer model
            comparing it with a diversity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
            detailing the transformer based approaches for medical image classification,
            segmentation, registration and reconstruction with a focus on the image

    <p>This research presents a new method for conditional monitoring based on the wind turbine power curve. The 
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution test from the field of statistics is employed in the assessment of turbine data 
      and the detection of abnormality (faults) in wind turbines. The process begins with anomaly detection and 
      filtration of faulty SCADA data by a quantile based filtration approach. Useful data comprising wind speed, 
      density, ambient temperature and pitch angle are utilized in the development of wind turbine power curve 
      models that represents actualities within wind farms. The radial basis function (RBF), multi-layer Perceptron 
      (MLP) and gradient boosting (GBR) methods utilized for model development are compared for predictive 
      accuracy using Mariano-Preve test, the null hypothesis assumes equal predictive ability (EPA). If rejected, an 
      algorithm compares the coefficients of correlation of the models and selects the closest to one (unity). The most 
      accurate model is utilized for the creation of a bin-wise distribution from past data and bin-wise confidence 
      levels from the plot of wind speed and output power. Cochranâ€™s method validates the minimum sample size that 
      will possess a sampling distribution similar to that of the population, a fault is detected if there is a reasonable 
      difference between the sample distribution and population distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, having a 
      null hypothesis of equivalent distributions, signals a fault if the null hypothesis is rejected. Two wind turbine 
      SCADA data sets associated with two fault events are used for the assessment of our method. Our results 
      indicate that our method effectively highlights abnormalities in power output relating to increased bearing 
      temperature and reduced generator rpm, aiding in the detection of faults long before they occur.</p>

            <p>Wind turbine power curve (WTPC) modelling is of great importance for energy assessment 
              and forecasting. In previous works, WTPC models were developed based on wind speed only. 
              However, in this research, we developed modelling methods that represent actual WTPC by 
              extensively considering wind farmsâ€™ topography, and several field conditions (other than wind 
              speed only) that are found to influence the power output of wind turbines such as climate 
              variability, the effect of neighbouring wind turbines, turbulence intensity, wake effect, ambient 
              temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind direction, and terrain conditions. We analyze the 
              radial basis function (RBF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures for sensitivity and 
              modelling accuracy. A filtered dataset is passed into the models and fitting accuracies are 
              computed alongside sensitivity analysis. The best-performing models are compared with 
              numerous parametric and non-parametric WTPC modeling schemes. It is found that the 
              quantile filtering (QF-NN) models outperforms all other models in terms of fitting accuracy, 
              and outperforms all selected hybrid models in terms of computation time.

          <p>Offshore wind power has been found to stand out among the most dynamic renewable energy technologies. With
its long coastal line, Nigeria has an overwhelming advantage in developing marine energy resources to relieve
the power crisis effectively. This work analyzed and characterized observation data of sea-surface wind speed
and direction at 30-minute intervals between 1979 and 2015 at five synoptic offshore stations in the Gulf of
Guinea. The seasonal variations in hourly surface wind speed and directions as well as the Weibull distribution of
wind speed and wind power at 100 m hub height were examined. The wind shears, capacity factors, and
accumulated energy outputs for seven offshore wind turbine types were determined for the selected locations. In
addition, the economic analysis of the selected offshore turbines using levelized cost of energy was carried out,
while sensitivity analysis of the total levelized cost of energy to key input parameters was further determined.
The results revealed large spatial and temporal variations in wind speed and wind power in the Gulf of Guinea.
The most viable offshore site for wind energy exploitation was Agbami (the deepest offshore site), while Bonny
(the shallow coastal site) had the least. The findings established very good fits (having mean bias (between
âˆ’ 0.08 msâˆ’ 1 and âˆ’ 2.44 msâˆ’ 1

), percentage bias (between âˆ’ 0.47% and âˆ’ 13.98%), correlation coefficients (be-
tween 0.97 and 0.98), Chi-square (between 0.2 and 1.2), and root mean square error (between 1.2 msâˆ’ 1 and 3.1

msâˆ’ 1
)) between Weibull distribution and the actual wind data. The wind turbines with the highest and the lowest
wind power densities, capacity factors, and power outputs across the seasons and sites were V236-15.0 MW and
Siemens SWT113, respectively. The levelized cost of energy was considered for the deep waters due to the
moderately high-capacity factors. The highest values ranged between 101.48 and 137.12 USD/MWh at Sea Eagle
with V236-15 MW and V117-4.2 MW, respectively, while the lowest ranged from 52.29 to 69.66 USD/MWh at
Agbami with V236-15 MW and Siemens (SWT113), respectively. The exploitation of Nigeriaâ€™s offshore wind
resources could also be dedicated to producing renewable hydrogen and can serve to meet the countryâ€™s
ambitious targets set for carbon neutrality by 2060.</p>

                <p>Formula SAE is a global competition, which challenges students to design and build a formula-style racecar, which they then compete with in a series of dynamic and static events. Hebron 
                  Motorsports, the formula student team in Covenant University designed and is currently 
                  implementing their designs against the 2023 Formula Student competition in Silverstone UK.
                  The electrical team considered three main systems to ensure durability and simplicity, being the 
                  first design ever attempted. They include; critical vehicle systems comprising engine control 
                  unit, sensors and actuators, the FSAE required safety system comprising safety shutdown 
                  buttons, switches, relay networks, break system plausibility device and circuit protection, 
                  electro-pneumatic shifting and additional designs comprising digitally controlled shifting, gear 
                  count display, neutral detector lights. Additionally, we considered compact wiring, purchasing 
                  cables of required length and compactness. We also ensured to employ standard terminations of 
                  cables to ensure system integrity. For the Safety Circuit Board, we ensured to incorporate 
                  appropriate redundancy in design that led us to print them as opposed to using perf boards 
                  whereas the shifting system circuit was implemented on a perf board. Schematics and detailed 
                  documentations were drafted on paper in order to help convey the information to people of other
                  disciplines. Each system was prototyped on a bench or by utilizing bred boards before they were 
                  implemented on the vehicle hence, separate wirings had to be provided.

        <p>I developed the Quantile Filtering Algorithm that is aimed at detecting and filtering out faulty Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. It is primarily designed for cleaning Wind Turbine operational SCADA data. It works by appending user defined quantiles on the probability distribution of Wind Turbine operational data that fall within specific wind speed intervals. This idea could be explained by hypothesis testing, where all data instances are tested for acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis which states that all the data instances are clean. P-values are obtained as probabilities of each data instance within the distribution while the significance (Î±) is equivalent to the user defined quantiles. The picture above depicts unfiltered data, the one below shows the effectiveness of Quantile Filtering Algorithm in detecting and removing faulty data.</p>

The largest vertical distance between the median data point and any data instance, and the distance from that median point to the reference x-plane are utilized for calculating significance levels for wind speed intervals (Bins) consecutively.</p>

                  <p>I volunteered to tutor machine learning and data analysis at Local Christian Assembly Lagos. I am currently developing training notebooks and files for Databases (MySQL), R and MLOps (FastAPI, Docker, YAML, github workflows for CI/CD, shell and bash scripting and serverless deployment)---click the link to view. I aim to help develop the next generation of role models in STEM, I strongly believe that the main reason for negative development among African youths, Nigeria in particular, is due to the dearth of positive role models to emulate.</p>
